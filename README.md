# What is Banano?
Banano is designed to be a feeless, instant, high throughput cryptocurrency.

We've applied the philosophy of "do one thing and do it well", giving you performance and scalability unmatched by any other platform.

### Key features
* Banano utilizes a novel block-lettuce architecture.
* Instant and Feeless transactions.
* Fungible (& Edible).
* Daily potassium airdrops.
* Ripe for memes.
* Literally grows on tree's, no mining required.
* Not a Shitcoin (until digested).
* No more confusing prefix, Bananos contain Banoshis.
* Replay Protection to stop attackers from executing replay attacks from chain X on chain Y and vice versa.
